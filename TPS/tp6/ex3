    Linux doesn't care about extensions.

    Windows cares about extensions.

- (By the way, try to explain why MsWindows, by default, hide file extensions from users.)
    Security reasons - it avoids users from changing or messing something up.
    Unnecessary.


A difference between Linux and Windows is how they treat application files vs data files. On Windows, the line between the two is blurred; 
there are a few types of executable files, and they are determined by their extension (.exe, .bat, etc.), but in most contexts you can 
“execute” any file (e.g. by clicking in Explorer), and this executes the executable that is associated with that file type, where the file type 
is entirely determined by the extension (so executing a .doc file might start c:\Program Files\something or other\winword.exe, executing a .py 
file might start a Python interpreter, etc.).

On Linux, there is a notion of executable file which is independent of the file name. Executables generally have no extension, because 
they're meant to be typed by the user. The type of the file is irrelevant, all the user wants to do is execute the file. The kernel determines 
how to execute the file from the file contents: it knows some file types natively, and the shebang mechanism allows a file to declare any other 
executable file¹ as its interpreter.

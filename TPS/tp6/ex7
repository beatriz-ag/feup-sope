Describe three of the file operations listed on the theoretical classes' supporting sheets that have a similar counterpart in the list of directory operations.

Why does the operation on directories readdir() not have an invocation syntax in Unix similar to the corresponding read() 

 The  readdir() function returns a pointer to a dirent structure representing
       the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed to by dirp.  It re‐
       turns  NULL  on  reaching the end of the directory stream or if an error oc‐
       curred.

read()  attempts  to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the
       buffer starting at buf.

       On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at the file off‐
       set, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.  If the
       file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and read() re‐
       turns zero.

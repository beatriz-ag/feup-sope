1. In a named pipe, the program described could be executed between unrelated processes.The first process would write to the first pipe the color and the 
second process would read it, process it and send its answer via the second pipe.

2. In normal/unnamed pipes, this inter-communication could only happen in between parent-child processes.

3. Signals don't send information and therefore could implement this communication.

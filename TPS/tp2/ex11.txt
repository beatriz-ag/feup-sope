Pipes are basically an IPC mechanism used for message passing between processes in a system. They signify information flow between sender and receiver processes.
The major differences between named and unnamed pipes are:

1. As suggested by their names, a named type has a specific name which can be given to it by the user. Named pipes are referred by name only by the reader and wirter.
All istances of a named pipe share the same pipe name. On the other hand, unnamed pipes are not a given a name. It is accessible through two file descriptors that
are created through the function pipe (fd[2]), where fd[1] signifies the write file descriptor, and fd[0] describes the read file descriptor.

2. An unnamed pipe is only used for communication between a child and its parent process, while a named pipe can be used for communication between two unnamed 
processes as well. Processes of differente ancestry can share data through a named pipe.

3. A named pipe exists in the file system. After input-output has been performed by the sharing processes, the pipe still exists in the file system 
independently of the process, and can be used for communication between some other processes. On the other hand, an unnamedpipe
vanishes as soon as it is closed, or one of the process(parent or child) completes execution.

4. Named pipes can be used to provide communication between processes on the same computer or between processes on different computers across a network, as in case of 
distributed system. Unnamed pipes are always local; the cannot be used for communication over a network.

5. A named pipe can have multiple processes communicating through it, like multiple clients connected to one server. On the other hand, an unnamed pipe is a one-way pipe that typically 
transfers data between a parent process and a child process.

All in all, an unnamed pipe is simple to use and incurs less overheads, whereas a named pipe provides greater functionalities.
